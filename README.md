React Infinite Calendar â€” monthly break
=======================================

This is a fork of the awesome https://github.com/clauderic/react-infinite-calendar

The purpose of this fork is to force each month to go back to a new line in the calendar:

| Original repo | With monthly break |
|---------------|--------------------|
| ![Original](.github/original.png) | ![Fork](.github/fork.png) |

Every other feature / behavior should remain as close as possible to the main repository. Feel free to add issues / PRs on this repository if this is related to this very behavior.
